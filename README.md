# Fondation Mono
## About
Fondation Mono is a thin monospaced font designed for use in horizontal text. It is completely free to use and is under the Open Font License. It is designed by Spentine with suggestions from acquaintances. Updates to the font will usually be tweaks or the addition of mathematical symbols. The latest version of the font may be downloaded here. Previous versions of the font may be accessed through GitHub.

The font may appear too thin in some circumstances, such as when writing code in languages that tend to contain less characters on a horizontal line. It may also appear too tall due to the proportion of the X-Height and the Cap Height being close to 1:2, with an actual ratio of 3:5 (1:1.67). Ensure use of the font is reviewed and does not interfere with the comprehension and/or readability of the text itself. A second, improved version of the font may be created sometime in the future to resolve the issues mentioned previously.
## Design
he font is designed with blockiness as the main foundation. The curves smooth out rough corners into more legible turns. Because of its simplistic nature, the design is easily extendable and expandable. The original design is not monospaced, but it was later decided down the line.
## Extra Information
The Shavian alphabet was included in the font for fun. Many of the characters were simplified for consistency with the rest of the font, which is most prominently displayed in the ligature characters such as êë∏, êëπ, êë∫, and êëª. Some extra characters were added becuase of its use alongside the standard Shavian alphabet, such as a centered ring dot, an interrobang, and a left-right arrow.

If you would like to provide feedback on the font or have questions about it, please contact me at spentines@gmail.com or through GitHub if possible. Keep in mind that I am uneducated regarding the legalities of font distribution. If you would also like to send your usage of the font, feel free to; I don't mind.
